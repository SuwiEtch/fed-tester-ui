This is a frontend for [matrix-federation-tester](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-federation-tester). A hosted instance is available at [lain.haus](https://neo.lain.haus/fed-tester).  
To get this running for yourself:
* install `nodejs, (p)npm, gulp`, and run `npm install`
* Change `apiUrl` in `app.js` to your own instance of [matrix-federation-tester](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-federation-tester)
* run `gulp build`
* if everything works, you should have a compiled build in the `build/` directory
